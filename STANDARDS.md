# Workflow 

We will be following a ticket-based workflow for all our projects. Each feature will be accompanied by a ticket, and you can choose what tickets you want to work on. 
Once you choose a ticket, you should make a git branch in the respective repository for that ticket and commit all your changes to that branch.  
When the feature is finished, open a pull-request and assign it to Roshan, Lucy and one of your peers. Everyone should be code-reviewing each other's code to make 
sure the code-style is maintained, there are no bugs and the feature is complete. 
Please don't push to master.

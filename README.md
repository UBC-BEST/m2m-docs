# Onboarding 

We'll be using [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html) and [Unity](https://unity.com/) for our app, and Python and Javascript for our backend server code.  
If you have used Java before, don't stress out - Kotlin is basically the same thing, just nicer looking. You can read some of the [docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html) so you can make sure I am not lying.  
Before you start any actual coding, you need to be familiar with a few concepts like Git, Server/Client Architecture and REST APIs. Luckily, you don't need to know them in depth, but just enough to be able to use them! Here's a few videos that'll help: 

- [Git Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)
- [Client Server Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-n_gyyNly8)
- [REST API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-BpqyOT3a8)

Follow the steps below to get started with both codebases on your local machines:  

## MACOS Users

Congratulations, you got the easier onboarding experience. 
- Install brew by copy-pasting this command in your terminal:  
`$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)" `
- Now you can install Android Studio using:
  `brew cask install android-studio `
- Once Android Studio is installed, follow the [Kotlin Setup](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mobile/setup.html) to finish setting up your IDE.
